This was set up by tennis enthusisasts who were used to the Fort Greene Tennis Association group in Brooklyn. That list has over a thousand members meaning that at just about any time you can find a partner of your level to play. It is an incredible resource and we miss it here in the Boston area. This list is starting small but we are hoping to get to a similar point.
